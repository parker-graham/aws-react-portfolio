# AWS Amplify / React Portfolio

this project is my personal portfolio, with the frontend done in react using create-react-app and CI/CD setup thru aws amplify.

after a long time of building the site's layout css from scratch, i decided to make it easier on myself and use react-bootstrap.
node-sass and etc. scss frameworks were added.

after completing the design as i intended, the last thing to do was finally add some content.
